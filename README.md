## eCommerce Backend APIs

The objective of this project is to develop an advanced e-commerce platform that facilitates the buying and selling of products. The platform will provide a user-friendly interface for customers to browse and purchase items, while also offering sellers a comprehensive dashboard to manage their product listings, track sales and earnings, and effectively communicate with customers.

### Key Features:

User Accounts: The platform will allow users to create individual accounts, enabling them to make purchases, track orders, and manage their personal information.

Admin Panel: Administrators will have exclusive access to an admin panel, which allows them to manage users, products, payments, and other site settings. They can review and approve new seller registrations, monitor transactions, and ensure the smooth operation of the platform.

Product Management: Sellers will have access to a Seller Dashboard where they can create, edit, and manage their product listings. They can upload high-quality images, provide detailed descriptions, set prices, and specify inventory levels.

Sales and Earnings Tracking: The Seller Dashboard will provide real-time sales data and earnings reports, empowering sellers to monitor their performance. They can view sales trends, track revenue, and gain insights into their most popular products.

Order Management: Sellers will be able to efficiently manage their orders through the Seller Dashboard. They can view and process incoming orders, update order statuses (such as shipped or delivered), and generate shipping labels or invoices.

Inventory Management: Sellers will have tools to manage their inventory effectively. They can track stock levels, receive low inventory alerts, and update product availability to ensure seamless transactions and avoid overselling.
